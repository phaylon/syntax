=head1 NAME

syntax - Activate syntax extensions

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # either
    use syntax 'foo';

    # or
    use syntax foo => { ... };

    # or
    use syntax qw( foo bar ), baz => { ... };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module activates community provided syntax extensions to Perl. You pass it
a feature name, and optionally a scalar with arguments, and the dispatching 
system will load and install the extension in your package.

The import arguments are parsed with L<Data::OptList>. There are no 
standardised options. Please consult the documentation for the specific syntax
feature to find out about possible configuration options.

The passed in feature names are simply transformed: C<function> becomes
L<Syntax::Feature::Function> and C<foo_bar> would become 
C<Syntax::Feature::FooBar>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 import

    syntax->import( @spec );

This method will dispatch the syntax extension setup to the specified feature
handlers for the calling package.

=head2 import_into

    syntax->import_into( $into, @spec );

Same as L</import>, but performs the setup in C<$into> instead of the calling
package.

=head2 unimport

    syntax->unimport( @features );

This method will trigger uninstallations of the C<@features> from the
calling package.

=head2 unimport_into

    syntax->unimport_into( $into, @features );

Same as L</unimport>, but will uninstall the C<@features> in C<$into>.

=head1 RECOMMENDED FEATURES
